# Coffee-News

Heroku link for testing purposes : https://coffee-news.herokuapp.com

Coffee-News is a web app designed to exercise my skills with React.

* FRONT is made with Ant Design (https://ant.design) and inline style. This app uses hooks, Redux and React Router Dom.

* BACK is a simple Express server (Node.js)

* API used is newsapi (https://newsapi.org)

Please note that originally, all API calls were made in the front-end, but since newsapi changed its pricing and do not authorize request from the browser unless it comes from localhost, I had to switch these calls to the back-end.
